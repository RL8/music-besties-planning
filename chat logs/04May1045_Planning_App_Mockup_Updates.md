## Major Themes Discussed

- Identified discrepancies between the planning app mockups and the actual implementation in the skeleton app

- Updated mockups to accurately reflect the current implementation

## Features Updated

### Edit Rankings View

### Sidebar Detail View
- Updated the sidebar panel to match the sliding panel implementation in the skeleton app
- Improved the tabs interface to match the actual implementation

## Technical Details

- Ensured consistent styling with the skeleton app implementation

## Next Steps

1. Continue reviewing other views in the planning app to ensure they match the skeleton app implementation
2. Update any remaining documentation to reflect the actual implementation
3. Ensure all status indicators accurately reflect the current state of implementation
4. Consider adding more detailed documentation about the interaction patterns in the skeleton app

## Documentation Updates
