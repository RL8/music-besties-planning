# DRY Principles Implementation

**Date:** May 4, 2025

## Major Themes Discussed

- Identified opportunities to improve the planning app by implementing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Focused on three key areas for improvement: common styles, component documentation templates, and reusable UI snippets
- Implemented a simple, practical approach without overengineering

## Features Implemented

### 1. Common Styles Extraction
- Created a common-styles.css file with reusable CSS classes
- Extracted frequently used inline styles into named classes
- Updated the DashboardCard component documentation to use these classes
- Linked the common styles to the main index.html file

### 2. Component Documentation Template
- Created a standardized template for documenting components
- Established a consistent structure for component documentation
- Applied the template to the DashboardCard component as an example
- Created documentation explaining how to use the template

### 3. Reusable UI Snippets
- Created a collection of HTML snippets for common UI elements
- Included snippets for chips, cards, sidebar panels, and modals
- Added comments to the Edit Rankings mockup referencing these snippets
- Created a templates directory to organize these resources

## Technical Details

- Created a new CSS file with classes for layout, typography, and UI elements
- Established a templates directory to house reusable code
- Added clear documentation on how to use the new resources
- Demonstrated practical application by updating existing files

## Next Steps

1. Continue applying common styles to other components in components.html
2. Update more mockups to reference the UI snippets
3. Consider creating additional templates for other documentation types
4. Establish a process for maintaining and updating these shared resources

## Documentation Updates

- Added README.md in the templates directory explaining how to use the resources
- Updated component documentation to demonstrate the new approach
- Added comments to mockups referencing the UI snippets

This implementation of DRY principles will make the planning app more maintainable and consistent, reducing duplication and making future updates more efficient.
