# Documentation Alignment Update

**Date:** May 4, 2025  
**Time:** 12:03 PM  

## Major Themes Discussed

- Identified discrepancies between planning app documentation and skeleton app implementation
- Established May 4, 2025 as the cutoff date for determining the source of truth
- Updated README to clarify the relationship between the planning app and skeleton app
- Updated mockups, component documentation, data model, and roadmap to reflect actual implementation

## Features Updated

### README.md
- Added clear explanation of the time-dependent relationship between planning app and skeleton app
- Clarified that pre-May 4 features use skeleton app as source of truth
- Established that post-May 4 features use planning app as source of truth
- Added development workflow and status indicator explanations

### Mockups (mocks.html)
- Updated Edit Rankings mockup to show chip-based UI instead of drag-and-drop list
- Updated Sidebar Detail mockup to match sliding panel implementation
- Changed status indicators to reflect completed features
- Added appropriate CSS styles for updated mockups

### Component Documentation (components.html)
- Updated EditRankingsTabs component status from "In Progress" to "Completed"
- Updated component preview to show chip-based UI
- Updated props and events documentation to match actual implementation

### Data Model (data-model.html)
- Updated Era data structure to match actual implementation
- Updated UserRankings data structure to reflect localStorage format
- Corrected storage implementation details

### Roadmap (roadmap.html)
- Updated Phase 1 MVP status to "Completed"
- Updated individual feature statuses to reflect actual implementation
- Updated feature descriptions to match actual implementation

## Technical Details

- All updates align with the actual implementation in the skeleton app
- Status indicators now accurately reflect what's implemented vs. what's planned
- Component documentation matches the actual props and events
- Data model documentation reflects the actual data structures used

## Next Steps

1. Continue using the planning app as the source of truth for all new features
2. Ensure all future mockups and documentation follow the established patterns
3. Update the story map if needed to reflect current implementation status
4. Consider adding more detailed documentation for future features

## Documentation Updates

- Updated documentation now accurately reflects the skeleton app implementation as of May 4, 2025
- Planning app now serves as both documentation for existing features and blueprint for future features
- Clear distinction between documentation of existing features and planning for future features

This alignment ensures consistency between documentation and implementation, providing a solid foundation for future development.
