## Relationship to Main App

The relationship between this planning app and the main Music Besties application is time-dependent:

### For Features Implemented Before May 4, 2025
- The skeleton app is the source of truth
- Mockups in this planning app document what was already built
- Planning app has been updated to match the existing implementation

### For Features Implemented After May 4, 2025
- This planning app is the source of truth
- Mockups and designs in this app guide future implementation
- The skeleton app should follow these designs

## Development Workflow
1. **Documentation Phase**: (Completed) Planning app mockups now match existing features
2. **Design Phase**: All new features are designed in the planning app first
3. **Implementation Phase**: New features in skeleton app follow planning app designs

## Status Indicators
- **Completed**: Feature exists in skeleton app as of May 4, 2025
- **In Progress**: Feature is being designed or implemented
- **Not Started**: Feature is planned for future implementation

This time-based approach ensures clear understanding of which app serves as the source of truth for any given feature.
